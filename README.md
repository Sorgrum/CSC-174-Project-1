## Ontology

The domain of the website are students at the University of Rochester. They are all Computer Science students.

## Taxonomy 

The website is laid out with a home page containing images of each student. When an image of the student is clicked, it takes you to the specific page for the student. The linked page contains a small biographical blurb for each student about their their life followed by a blurb about their current educational interests at the University.

The reason there is a small biographical blurb is to introduce the student's background before introducing newer information about the student in order to provide context about the student and why they made their educational decisions.

## Choreography

The students are organized alphabetically. The biography pages have the student's name as the largest element in order to draw attention to the name of the student. Directly below it has relevant information about the user like their major, class, and school. Below it contains text describing the students background and educational interests.
