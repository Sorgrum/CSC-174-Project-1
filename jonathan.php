        <p>My name is Jonathan Roman. I'm from Tenafly, NJ and was born September 6th, 1997. I currently attend the University of Rochester with a major in Computer Science. MY hobbies include playing video games and basketball, both of which I participate in groups around campus for.</p>
        <p>I had always been into video games and technology since I was old enough to operate a screen, so it seemed logical that I would like computer science, but my school did not offer anything in the field, so I entered the University of Rochester with a major in biology. Once I arrived at college, I continued with my track for a year or two before I began taking classes in computer science and instantly fell in love with it. I did not realize how much I would truly enjoy the field but I am extremely happy I will end up being able to complete my major within the 4 years even with some extra classes from other fields under my belt.</p>
