            <p>Hello! My name is Pooja Priya. I prefer to go by my last name Priya. I am currently a junior at the University of Rochester, majoring in Digital Media Studies and Computer Science. I grew up in Patna, India. It is a big city located near the India-Nepal border. In the Indian education system, it is common for high school students to choose from either the sciences, humanities and business streams. My high school was very focused on the sciences and as a result, I took classes in physics, chemistry and biology. In high school, computer science used to be my favorite subject and so I chose that as my major when I got to college. After my first semester, I realized that the University of Rochester curriculum was a lot more flexible in terms of which classes I could take. I took a few music and design classes to explore my interests and realized that I really liked studying what makes good design, and I ended up adding Digital Media Studies as a second major.</p>
            <p>This past summer I was part of a field school in Ghana which focused on the surveying, reconstruction and structural analysis of Elmina castle and a few other forts along the coast of Ghana. I was able to learn how to use technology such as photogrammetry, which involves taking pictures of an object from multiple angles and then reconstructing it using software. The course also involved the use of technology such as laser scanning and 3D reconstruction. It was very educational for me and helped me narrow down what kind of career path I want to pursue. I am not entirely certain, but I would like to work in a research environment exploring how digital technologies for mixed reality can be combined with the humanities.</p>
