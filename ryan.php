            <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Lin. I’m a junior at the University of Rochester, majoring in mechanical engineering. I am also pursuing minors in computer science and music. I’m a singer and a pianist, taking voice lessons at Eastman School of Music. Both my parents emmigrated from Taiwan, and graduated from Eastman. They are now both successful musicians, raising me with a classical music upbringing. My father is a violinist in the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, and my mother is a piano teacher, choir conductor, and even taught the Texas Boys Choir.</p>
            <p>I came into college with 23 credit hours. I took many more AP classes, but many of them didn’t count for classes. In addition, I took summer courses at Cornell, earning 7 credit hours in physics and engineering. While my mechanical engineering and computer science can be interesting and even exciting at times, it is relieving to balance out that analytical thinking with my more creative side in my music classes. I’m even taking advantage of the fact we have a wonderful and prestigious music school right next door, Eastman School of Music, and have an instructional voice teacher there. I don’t have any overlapping classes however, which means to graduate on time, I’m taking 19-20 credits every semester. I’m able to keep on top of it, however, because I don’t want to regret not taking advantage of these four years I’m allowed to solely pursue education. If taking five classes is the same price as four, there’s no excuse not to learn as much as possible.</p>
